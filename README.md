<h1>React Minesweeper</h1>
<p>This project was my first ever project exploring React. It served as a learning tool to me to learn and experiment with React. As such please ignore any bad code, poor practices and any mistakes, I've (hopefully) improved and learned a lot since ðŸ˜….</p>

<br />

<p>This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).</p>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
